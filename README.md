This is Harvard's CS50's guided project. </br>**runner.py** file was already provided by the CS50's staff which contains the GUI for the game (uses pygame) while **minimax_tictactoe.py** contains the logic of the game which I had to complete. </br>
If you don't have the **pygame** module, then run **pip3 install -r requirements.txt** to download it.</br>
